# ✊ Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a fun and interactive command-line Rock Paper Scissors game written in Python! The user plays against the computer, and each round offers immediate feedback on who wins.

## 🚀 Features

- **Single-player mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Randomized choices**: The computer’s choice is randomized each round.
- **Instant Feedback**: After each round, see if you won, lost, or tied.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the scores for both you and the computer across rounds.


## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leshokefa/RockPaperScissorsByLesho.git
    cd RockPaperScissorsByLesho
    ```

2. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python rock_paper_scissors.py
    ```

3. **Play the game**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
   - Each round will show whether you won, lost, or tied with the computer.
   - Play as many rounds as you like, and keep track of your score!

## 📖 How It Works

The game uses Python’s `random` module to randomly select the computer's choice in each round. The game then compares the player’s choice to the computer’s choice to determine the outcome based on traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:

- **Rock beats Scissors**
- **Scissors beat Paper**
- **Paper beats Rock**

### Key Functions

- **Input Handling**: The game validates your input to ensure it’s a valid choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- **Randomized Computer Choice**: The computer’s choice is generated randomly each round.
- **Score Tracking**: A simple scoring system keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas to improve or expand the project:

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow two players to play against each other.
- **Extended Rounds**: Add the option to play a fixed number of rounds and declare an overall winner.
- **GUI**: Build a graphical interface with Tkinter to make the game more interactive.
